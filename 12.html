 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> According to Hippolytus:
 <P>
  <UL>
    Andrew preached to the Scythians [modern day Georgia]
    and Thracians [modern day Bulgaria], and was 
	<FONT COLOR="red"><B>crucified</B></FONT>,
    suspended on an olive tree, at Patrae, a town of Achaia [Greece];

<LI> <B>Bartholomew</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> According to Hippolytus, Bartholomew preached in India:
 <P>
  <UL>
  Bartholomew, again, preached to the Indians,
  to whom he also gave the Gospel according to Matthew,
   and was <FONT COLOR="red"><B>crucified</B></FONT>
   with his head downward, and was buried
  in Allanum, a town of the great Armenia
  [modern day southern Georgia].
  </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> Eusebius, in his Church History,
	confirms the ministry of Bartholomew in India,
	and adds an eye witness account:
 <P>
 <UL>
  About that time, Pantaenus, a man highly distinguished
  for his learning, had charge of the school of the faithful
  in Alexandria... Pantaenus...is said to have gone to India.
  It is reported that among persons there who knew of Christ,
   he found the Gospel according to Matthew, which had anticipated
   his own arrival. For Bartholomew, one of the apostles,
   had preached to them, and left with them the writing of Matthew
  in the Hebrew language, which they had preserved till that time.
   ---- (Book 5, Chapter 10)

<P>
<LI> <B>James, Son of Alphaeus</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Hippolytus identifies that James was stoned to death in Jerusalem:
 <P>
  <UL>
	And James the son of Alphaeus, when preaching in Jerusalem,
	was <FONT COLOR="red"><B>stoned to death</B></FONT>
	 by the Jews, and was buried there beside
	the temple.
  </UL>
 </UL>


<P>
<LI> <B>James, Son of Zebedee</B>
 <P>
 James was the brother of John, the disciple "that Jesus loved".
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> According to the Book of Acts in the New Testament, 
	James was killed by Herod:
  <P>
   <UL>
  Act 12:1  And at that time Herod the king threw on his hands to 
	oppress some of those of the church. 
  <BR>
  Act 12:2  And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 
  </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> This is confirmed by Hippolytus:
 <P>
  <UL>
    James, his brother, when preaching in Judea,
    <FONT COLOR="red"><B>was cut off with the sword</B></FONT>
	 by Herod the tetrarch,
    and was buried there.
  </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> Eusebius descibed more precisely what was cut off of James:
 <P>
 <UL>
 First Stephen was stoned to death by them, and after him James,
  the son of Zebedee and the brother of John, was beheaded...
  (Book 3, Chapter 5)
 </UL>
 <P>
  Yep... James' head was cut...

 </UL>

<P>
<LI> <B>John, brother of James and son of Zebedee</B>
 <P>
 John was one of the few disciples that did not die a cruel death, but
	of "old age".
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Eusebius discusses the reason that John wrote his Gospel:
 <P>
 <UL>
 "Matthew and John have left us written memorials, and they,
 tradition says, were led to write only under the pressure of
 necessity...And when Mark and Luke had already published their
 Gospels, they say that John, who had employed all his time in
 proclaiming the Gospel orally, finally proceeded to write for
 the following reason. The three Gospels already mentioned having
  come into the hands of all and into his own too, they say that
 he accepted them and bore witness to their truthfulness;
  but that 
  <FONT COLOR="red"><B>there was lacking in them an account of the deeds
  done by Christ at the beginning of his ministry</B></FONT>."
 (Book 3, Chapter 24)
 </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> According to Hippolytus, John was banished by Domitian
 to the Isle of Patmos, and later died in Ephesus:
 <P>
 <UL>
 John, again, in Asia, was banished by Domitian the king
 to the isle of Patmos, in which also he wrote his Gospel
 and saw the apocalyptic vision; and 
  <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>in Trajan's time he fell
 asleep at Ephesus</B></FONT>, where his remains were sought for,
 but could not be found. 
 </UL>
 </UL>


<P>
<LI> <B>Matthew/Levi</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Eusebius referenced to Bishop Papias of Hierapolis, 
	as early as c. 110 A.D., bearing witness
        to Matthew's authorship of his gospel:
 <P>
  <UL>
  ....Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord]
  in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted
  them as best he could." (Eusebius, Book 3, Chapter 39)
 </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> According to Hippolytus:
  <P>
  <UL>
  Matthew wrote the Gospel in the Hebrew tongue,
   and published it at Jerusalem, and 
   <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>fell asleep</B></FONT> at Hierees,
    a town of Parthia.\224 [Parthia is near modern day Tehran]
  </UL>
 </UL>

<P>
<LI> <B>Simon/Peter</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Eusebius, quoting Papias of Hierapolis (c. 110 A.D.),
	records a tradition that the Gospel of Mark preserved
	the Gospel as preached by Peter:
 <P>
  <UL>
	"Mark having become the interpreter of Peter,
	wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered....
	he accompanied Peter..." ---- (Book 3, Chapter 39)
  </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> Irenaeus (c. 180 A.D.) records a similar tradition,
   and mentions that Peter and Paul founded the Church in Rome:
 <P>
 <UL>
  "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews
   in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome,
   and laying the foundations of the Church.
   After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter,
   did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter..."
    ---- (Irenaeus, "Against Heresies", Book 3, Chapter 1)
 </UL>
 <P>
 <LI> Eusebius records that Peter was put to death under Nero in Rome:
 <P>
 <UL>
  It is, therefore, recorded that 
  <FONT COLOR="magenta"><B>Paul was beheaded in Rome</B></FONT> itself,
  and that 
  <FONT COLOR="red"><B>Peter likewise was crucified under Nero</B></FONT>.
  This account of Peter and Paul is substantiated by the fact
  that their names are preserved in the cemeteries of that place
  even to the present day.
   ---- (Book 2, Chapter 25)
  </UL>
 <P>
 (Paul was a Roman citizen can cannot be crucified but got an
	"easier" death sentence)
 <P>
 <LI> Hippolytus confirmed the fact that Peter was crucified by Nero in Rome:
  <P>
  <UL>
   Peter preached the Gospel in Pontus, and Galatia, and Cappadocia,
   and Betania, and Italy, and Asia, and 
    <FONT COLOR="red"><B>was afterwards crucified
   by Nero in Rome with his head downward, as he had himself desired
   to suffer in that manner</B></FONT>.
  </UL>
 </UL>

<P>
<LI> <B>Philip</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> According to Hippolytus, Philip preached and was executed
in what today is eastern Turkey:
 <P>
  <UL>
   Philip preached in Phrygia, and 
   <FONT COLOR="red"><B>was crucified</B></FONT> in Hierapolis
   with his head downward in the time of Domitian, and was buried there.
  </UL>

<P>
<LI> <B>Simon the Zealot</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> According to Hippolytus, Simon the Zealot was
the second Bishop of Jerusalem:
 <P>
  <UL>
   Simon the Zealot, the son of Clopas, who is also called Jude,
   became bishop of Jerusalem after James the Just,
   and fell asleep and 
 <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>was buried there at the age of 120 years</B></FONT>.
  </UL>
 </UL>

<P>
<LI> <B>Thaddaeus/Judas son of James</B>
 <P>
 According to Mat 10:3 (KJV): Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew
  the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and <B>Lebbaeus,
  whose surname was Thaddaeus</B>....
  Thaddaeus is also known as Lebbaeus.
 <UL>
 <LI> Hippolytus records:
 <P>
  <UL>
   Jude, who is also called Lebbaeus, preached to the people of Edessa,
   and to all Mesopotamia, and <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>fell asleep</B></FONT>
    at Berytus, and was buried there.
